Hydra-Config
============

A more modular and extensible take on a Hydra configuration. 

#### Design Consideraitons
 
I've opted against using the hydra.ext namespace, as I have written my own importer to take care of this. Ideally, everything should be erased, and re-loaded upon config reload. This is something hydra.ext doesn't really take care of in a way that I like.


### Important Files

 * `config.lua` - The configuration file, that contains configuration options for every module.
 * `init.lua` - The bootstrapper that loads modules defined in the config, and handles the menu. 
 
### Utils
I've written a few utilities to take care of some general purpose functionality: 

 * `utils/find.lua` - Convenience methods for finding windows, and audio devices. 
 * `utils/import.lua` - My own take of require() with its own cache. Use `import` everywhere you would have used `require`. `init.lua` takes care of clearing the cache, each reload, so you don't have to worry.
 * `utils/inspect.lua` - Table inspector from http://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua
 * `utils/monitors.lua` - Monitor detection & window positioning helpers.
 * `utils/position.lua` - Functions to resize a window within a screen. 
 
### Modules 
A few modules to handle stuff I needed hydra to do:

* `modules/reload.lua` - Handles reloading hydra.
* `modules/repl.lua` - Handles launching the repl.
* `modules/updates.lua` - Handles checking for Hydra updates.
* `modules/lock.lua` - Handles locking the screen when F13 is pressed.
* `modules/arrows.lua` - Handles positioning a window on the current screen.
* `modules/monitors.lua` - Handles moving windows between screens. 
* `modules/arrangement.lua` - Handles building window arrangements, that arrange windows on multiple screens. I use this to move windows to different monitors automatically.
